# Tic Tac Toe

[LIVE DEMO](https://andrewbayly.github.io/TicTacToe/index.html "Live Demo")

An implementation of a TicTacToe solver, which uses the Minimax algorithm to search for
the best move. Expect to draw or lose. You won't win, but you can try. Click one of the 
buttons to start a new game - either you start or the computer starts.
